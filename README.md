# CMPT225

Assignment 1 - 
You are to write a C++ program that reads in a text file and checks that all occurrences of the 
grouping symbols (,),{,}, and [,] are correctly matched and nested.
(The text file could be, for example, a C++ source code file, although actual source code files provide 
problems that you will not be solving, such as distinguishing content inside comments).
If there is any incorrect matching or nesting, the program prints out a message, as described below, 
identifying where the first error was identified and the nature of the error. 
If no errors are found, it prints a line containing only the string "No Errors Found".

Assignment 2 - 
This assignment is an exercise in simple dynamic data structures. 
You will create a dynamic implementation of a deque.
A deque is a "double-ended queue";
in other words, an ADT that stores a sequence of values or objects and has insertion and removal at both ends. 
(It is a generalization of both the classic stack and queue). 
The implementation is using a doubly-linked list.
That is, a linked list in which each node (except the first) has a point to the previous node, as well as the next node, in the list.
